Here are the main components and their functions:\n","\n","1. Installing required libraries: The code installs several Python packages, including `langchain`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, `faiss-cpu`, `tiktoken`, `sentence_transformers`, and `Gradio`. These libraries are used to build the Q&A system.\n","\n","2. Loading user API key: The script retrieves an API key from the notebook's user data, which is likely needed for some external services like Together AI.\n","\n","3. Setting up the Q&A retriever: The tutorial demonstrates creating a question-answering system using different embedding models and vector databases. Here, `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` from the `langchain-community` library is used with the `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` model for text embeddings. The embedded documents are stored in a FAISS (FAST AI Similarity Search) vector store.\n","\n","4. Loading and splitting data: The code loads text content from either a web page or a local file using `WebBaseLoader` or `TextLoader`. The loaded text is then split into smaller chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for efficient indexing.\n","\n","5. Creating an example data set with metadata: The split documents are used to create a vector store, which serves as the searchable database for the Q&A system.\n","\n","6. Building a retriever: A retriever is created from the FAISS vector store, allowing it to search and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. In this case, the `search_kwargs` parameter specifies that three most similar documents should be returned for each query.\n","\n","7. Integrating a language model: The tutorial uses Together AI's Open Hermes model (`teknium/OpenHermes-2p5-Mistral-7B`) to generate answers based on the retrieved context. The `Together` class from the `langchain-together` library is used for this purpose.\n","\n","8. Creating a chain: A pipeline, or \"chain,\" is created by combining the retriever, prompt template, language model, and output parser. This chain allows the system to take a question as input and return an answer based on the retrieved context.\n","\n","9. Invoking the chain: Finally, the chain is invoked with a sample question (\"How did they start Instagram?\") to demonstrate how the Q&A system works. The answer is generated by combining the relevant documents retrieved from the vector store and using the language model to generate an appropriate response.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14215,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989147348,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"IfCt8bhHNu9u"},"outputs":[],"source":["#from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n","#from langchain_together.embeddings import TogetherEmbeddings\n","from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\n","\n","#embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n","#embeddings = TogetherEmbeddings(model=\"togethercomputer/m2-bert-80M-2k-retrieval\")\n","embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"intfloat/multilingual-e5-small\")\n","\n","from operator import itemgetter\n","\n","from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n","from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda, RunnablePassthrough"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989147349,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"tZZH-NyTpgeR"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989147349,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"YkJerSHmn3iv"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n","from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":446,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989147792,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"qyt3sv3sopbh"},"outputs":[],"source":["import bs4"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989399206,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"P6HRkZB4omKP"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog.\n","#loader = WebBaseLoader(\n","#    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),\n","#    bs_kwargs=dict(\n","#        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(\n","#            class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\")\n","#        )\n","#    ),\n","#)\n","\n","loader = TextLoader(\"/content/Instagram_ Kevin Systrom & Mike Krieger-transcript.txt\")\n","\n","docs = loader.load()\n","\n","text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)\n","splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YTDxLMs_vg8K"},"source":["## Example data with metadata attached"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16392,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989399205,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"aHpTW4wcNsY0"},"outputs":[],"source":["# get the wines in the store\n","vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(splits, embeddings)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M-DU2BD6sPJj"},"source":["## Creating our retriever"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989399206,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"GWW_t_MFsKC8"},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain_together import Together"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989400283,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Cjo9-YU5rCnv"},"outputs":[],"source":["llm = Together(\n","    model=\"teknium/OpenHermes-2p5-Mistral-7B\",\n","    temperature=0.3,\n","    max_tokens=256,\n","    top_k=50,\n","    # together_api_key=\"...\"\n",")\n","\n","retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 3})"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":262,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708989402127,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"40kasklQsfx1","outputId":"f673ea93-e59b-4698-a73b-112197108a61"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[Document(page_content=\"Huge lesson, number one, people read the docs that, you know, you put out and you should care about them as a founder.
