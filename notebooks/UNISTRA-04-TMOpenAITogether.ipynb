Our focus will be on avoiding the exhaustive approach of processing each document with an LLM. We'll employ BERTopic, a flexible topic modeling framework that can utilize any LLM to refine topic delineations.\n","\n","BERTopic simplifies the process into five clear steps: embedding documents, dimensionality reduction of embeddings, clustering of embeddings, document tokenization by cluster, and extraction of the most representative words for each topic.\n","<br>\n","<div>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/assets/25746895/e9b0d8cf-2e19-4bf1-beb4-4ff2d9fa5e2d\" width=\"500\"/>\n","</div>\n","\n","With the advent of advanced LLMs like **Mistral or Gemma**, our capacity for topic modeling has greatly expanded beyond simple word lists. Direct analysis of all documents by Llama 2 is computationally impractical. Although vector databases offer a solution for search, determining the precise topics of interest remains a challenge.\n","\n","We propose a novel approach: utilizing BERTopic to generate clusters and topics, then employing Mixtral to refine and enhance these into more precise topic representations.\n","\n","This method merges the strengths of both worlds: BERTopic's efficient topic generation and Mixtral's refined topic representation.\n","<br>\n","<div>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic/assets/25746895/7c7374a1-5b41-4e93-aafd-a1587367767b\"

This setup involves specifying the together.ai API as the base URL and providing the necessary API key. The compatibility with the OpenAI format simplifies this process, allowing for a smooth integration. And later you can swap out for chatGPT or a local LLM.\n","\n","2. **Model Selection and Request**: Our model of choice for this task is the Mixtral model from Mistral. Through the OpenAI package, we will craft a request that aligns with the together.ai API specifications. This step includes defining the task, such as text classification or generation, and setting parameters like temperature for controlling the output's creativity.\n","\n","3. **Execution and Output Retrieval**: With the request formulated, we execute it via the OpenAI client, which communicates with the together.ai API backend. The backend, understanding the OpenAI format, efficiently processes our request using the specified Mixtral model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import userdata"],"metadata":{"id":"6ijpxZZBAj8A"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from openai import OpenAI"],"metadata":{"id":"7hndz9el-r0n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["TOGETHER_API_KEY = userdata.get('TOGETHER_API_KEY')"],"metadata":{"id":"RLL9yv2MAdgt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708727849533,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1595,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Point to the local server\n","client = OpenAI(base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\", api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY)"],"metadata":{"id":"O5EjzCO4-tDS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708727851991,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":472,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IvySvTeHTyLZ"},"source":["## **Prompt Engineering**\n","\n","To check whether our model is correctly loaded, let's try it out with a few prompts."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"hMqzTgk-mabE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708727853971,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":310,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["system = \"You are a helpful assistant\"\n","user = \"Could you explain to me training dogs works as if I am 5?\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n","  model=\"NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO\", # this field is currently unused\n","  messages=[\n","    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system},\n","    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user}\n","  ],\n","  temperature=0.2,\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"A-oyAEyyAW1B","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708727857878,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2531,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(textwrap.fill(completion.choices[0].message.content, width=100))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qXNG3SNHAsPW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708727857879,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Jurowetzki","userId":"04050209569183343689"}},"outputId":"094cd94b-15b7-408f-aed5-33a1c1cca59f"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Of course!
