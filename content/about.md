Hi there, I'm Roman, and welcome to this course on modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). My academic and professional journey has been deeply intertwined with the dynamics of technology. Since diving into NLP techniques in 2013, I've leveraged them significantly during my Ph.D., focusing primarily on method development. This focus has been particularly relevant in my work with bibliometric data and patents.

Currently, I'm collaborating with UNESCO on projects related to neurotechnology and AI. You can check out our latest report [here](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000386137).

Beyond my work with UNESCO, I'm actively involved in the Danish and Nordic open-source NLP/Large Language Models (LLM) community. Excitingly, my model (though a collaborative effort) currently tops the Open Scandinavian LLM leaderboard. You can see the leaderboard [here](https://scandeval.com/mainland-scandinavian-nlg/).

I also spearhead the AI Denmark project, where we partner with small and medium-sized enterprises to foster AI innovation and application.

From time to time, you might find me in the Danish media, offering insights on AI-related developments within the local context.
