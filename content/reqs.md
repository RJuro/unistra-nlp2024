title: "Technical Requirements"

Some notes on technical requirements:

1. We'll use Google Colab for computation, which provides free GPU access for certain tutorials. You'll need a Google account to use this.
2. Alternatively, you can run everything locally if you prefer and are comfortable with local installations.
3. [Together.ai](http://together.ai) will be used along with their API for accessing hosted LLMs. By creating an account on their platform, you'll receive 25$ worth of resources. If you follow the tutorials diligently, you should have more than 24.5$ by the end of the workshop.
4. A [Huggingface](http://huggingface.co) account is required for two main reasons: a) to run Argilla's user interface and b) to access models and host your data and models if needed.
