## Deriving Insights from Lengthy Documents with LLMs

Can we get an LLM to "digest" a long document and provide structured information?
This tutorial focuses on utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract structured information from exceptionally long documents. The challenge lies in enabling the model to perform advanced analysis while maintaining a consistent output format, accounting for all relevant details, and avoiding off-topic or fabricated responses.

We will explore techniques for guiding the LLM to deliver accurate and comprehensive insights from lengthy documents, ensuring that the model remains on track and provides valuable information.
