## Political Tweets - Simple Classifier: A Refresher in NLP

Welcome to this tutorial designed to give you a fresh update in Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In this project, we perform simple text classification to predict the political leaning of tweets. Our goal is to create a model that can accurately classify tweets as either Republican or Democratic using a Logistic Regression pipeline trained on preprocessed data.

## What to Expect

- Installation and use of essential NLP libraries such as `tweet-preprocessor`, `imbalanced-learn`, and `gradio`.
- Data manipulation and text preprocessing with Python modules like `pandas`, `numpy`, `spacy`, and `scikit-learn`.
- Creation and evaluation of a machine learning model using `LogisticRegression` and `TfidfVectorizer`.
- Handling imbalanced datasets using `RandomUnderSampler` from `imbalanced-learn`.
- Model explanation with `eli5` and creation of a user-friendly interface with `Gradio`.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to build a machine learning pipeline for text classification using Python libraries and how to create an interactive web application. Let's dive in!
